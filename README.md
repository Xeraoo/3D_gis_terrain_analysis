# 3D Modeling and Analysis in GIS - Project 4

## Overview

This repository contains a GIS project focused on 3D modeling and spatial analysis techniques. The project was created using data and tools available in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment and illustrates various terrain analysis methods such as TIN models, contour lines, slope calculations, shading, observation points, and visibility analysis. The project map outputs represent a wide array of geospatial data visualized and analyzed for educational purposes.

## Contents

### 1. **TIN (Triangulated Irregular Network) Model**
   - **Description**: A TIN model is used to represent the surface elevation with triangular facets.
   - **Legend**: Shows elevation values (meters above sea level) classified into different ranges, with edge types distinguishing between soft and hard edges based on topography.
   
### 2. **Topogrid**
   - **Description**: A raster-based elevation grid derived from contour lines, showing smooth terrain representation.
   - **Legend**: Elevation values represented in a continuous scale.

### 3. **Contour Lines (Warstwice)**
   - **Description**: Contour lines (isolines) are generated to show changes in elevation at regular intervals. The project includes both TIN-derived and grid-derived contours.
   - **Legend**: Contours are categorized based on different data sources.

### 4. **Slope Analysis**
   - **Description**: This map displays the slope steepness (in degrees) across the study area.
   - **Legend**: Highlights steep and flat areas using red (vertical triangles) and green (horizontal triangles) symbols.

### 5. **Shading (Hillshade)**
   - **Description**: A hillshade map is created using a simulated light source to represent how the terrain would appear with shadows. This improves visual interpretation of the landscape's 3D structure.
   - **Legend**: Shows the intensity of shading, with higher values indicating brighter areas and lower values showing darker/shaded regions.

### 6. **Observation Points**
   - **Description**: This map analyzes the visibility from specific observation points across the terrain. It identifies areas that can be observed from these locations.
   - **Legend**: Observation towers are marked, and the intensity of visibility is represented, showing the number of towers from which each part of the terrain is visible.

### 7. **Visibility Path (Trasa Widokowa)**
   - **Description**: A visibility path analysis map shows areas that are visible and non-visible along a predefined observation path. 
   - **Legend**: Differentiates between visible and non-visible areas along the observation route.

## Tools and Software

- GIS software (e.g., ArcGIS, QGIS)
- Spatial analysis tools for generating TIN, contour lines, hillshade, and visibility analysis
- Terrain analysis extensions for slope and shading calculations
